Wow, Screamboat. Where to even start with this roller coaster madness? Or maybe I'm just dizzy from the crazy loud theater back there, like trying to have a rock concert in a shoebox. My ears are ringing like old church bells and I can still taste the buttery popcorn, or are those just crumbs on my shirt? It's like the   smeared itself onto me physically, you know? 

Oh God, the opening scene! Just out the gates with those haunting foghorn sounds, felt like I was pinned down by a fjord or something. Really got under my skin — like that itchy tag on the back of my shirt that I kept trying to ignore.

> And then boom, straight into that bizarre, almost Lynchian dream sequence that slid into a car chase through a labyrinthine city. Who choreographs a chase through a labyrinth? Makes you feel like your brain's trying to do backflips or something.

Pirate clowns. Pirate clowns as far as the eye could see, which made absolutely no sense — it’s like the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮makers threw a dart at a wall full of random ideas and just ran with it, like “Yeah, why not!” And at some point, someone spilled their drink and it rolled all the way down the steps. I kept staring at it, hoping it wouldn't pool near my feet.

And omg, remember the part with the talking platypus? Pure genius or utter insanity, I can't decide — it was like seeing a politician tap dance and suddenly start speaking only in interpretive dance. Old school chaos, without a hint of order, which kinda felt right, surprisingly. A mate asked if I’d 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   – yeah, not sure if it’s legal or whatever, but I might need to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again just to make sense of it all.

Am I even making sense? Sheesh. But my back's definitely gonna need some yoga tomorrow. Maybe it’s my own fault, sitting like a pretzel and all. At any moment, I expected the   to have a random info dump like I’m having here, but it never did, and maybe that’s why it's stuck in my brain like peanut butter in the roof of your mouth.

My friend texted, “Just how was it?” I paused and jotted this down instead, unsure how to truly convey the carnival of pleasures and confusions that just unfolded. I might sound deranged, but what can you do? They really nailed the cacophony of colors and sounds — it's like eating a snow cone while someone reads your Tarot cards. Ok, time to unwind the knots in my head... and back.

```cpp
int main() {
    for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        int ship = i  7;
    // no sail, no sea, just endless water
    return 0;
}
